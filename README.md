 JavaScript Utility Program

This program demonstrates various JavaScript functions that perform string and array manipulations, as well as mathematical computations based on user input.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔤 String Functions:
- **Reverse a string**: Displays the reversed version of the input string.
- **Count characters**: Counts the number of characters in a string.
- **Capitalize**: Capitalizes the first letter of the string.

### 🔢 Array Functions:
- **Find Min & Max**: Calculates the minimum and maximum values from an array of numbers.
- **Sum**: Adds all numbers in the array.
- **Filter Numbers > 6**: Returns all numbers greater than 6.

### ➗ Math Functions:
- **Factorial**: Computes the factorial of a given number.
- **Prime Check**: Determines whether a number is prime.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to:
   - Enter a string
   - Enter a list of numbers (space-separated)
   - Enter a number

2. It then:
   - Applies various functions to the inputs
   - Displays the results in the console

## 💡 Example Input

- String: `"hello"`
- Number list: `"1 5 8 2 10"`
- Number: `5`

## 📤 Example Output

Reversed String: olleh
Number of characters: 5
Capitalized String: Hello
The min is: 1
The max is: 10
The sum of the array is: 26
Numbers bigger than 6: 8, 10
Factorial of 5 is: 120
Is 5 prime? true
Fibonacci sequence up to 5: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
